# AI Prompts and Responses for Midterm Question 4

This document contains the key prompts and AI responses used during the implementation of the smart campus device system with inheritance and interface implementation. This file was generated by the AI assistant based on our conversation during the Midterm Question 4 implementation process.

## Prompt 1
**Prompt**: "Design and implement a small smart-campus device system showing both class inheritance (concrete classes extend a common abstract class) and interface implementation. Create Device abstract class, Networked and BatteryPowered interfaces, and concrete classes DoorLock, Thermostat, and Camera."

**AI Response Excerpt**: "I'll help you implement a smart campus device system with proper inheritance and interface implementation. Let me start by creating the package structure and implementing all the required classes according to the specifications."

## Prompt 2: Abstract Base Class Implementation
**Prompt**: "The Device class is partially implemented for you. You must not modify this code, but you will use it in your subclasses. All subclasses must call super(id, location) in their constructors."

**AI Response Excerpt**: "I'll create the Device abstract class exactly as provided, ensuring it includes the constructor validation, protected setConnected method, and abstract getStatus method that subclasses will implement."

## Prompt 3: Interface Design
**Prompt**: "Create Networked interface with connect(), disconnect(), and isConnected() methods, and BatteryPowered interface with getBatteryPercent() and setBatteryPercent() methods. Concrete classes may satisfy Networked using Device's protected setter and public getter."

**AI Response Excerpt**: "I'll create both interfaces with the specified method signatures. The Networked interface will work with Device's connection state management, and BatteryPowered will handle battery percentage validation."

## Prompt 4: Concrete Device Implementation
**Prompt**: "Implement DoorLock extending Device and implementing Networked, BatteryPowered; Thermostat extending Device and implementing Networked; Camera extending Device and implementing Networked, BatteryPowered. All fields must be private and methods implemented exactly as specified."

**AI Response Excerpt**: "I'll implement each concrete class with proper inheritance, interface implementation, and the exact method signatures specified. Each class will have appropriate private fields and constructors that call super(id, location)."

## Prompt 5: Driver Class and Testing
**Prompt**: "Create the provided Main driver class that demonstrates polymorphism, exception handling, and heartbeat functionality. The code must compile and run with the provided Main.java unchanged."

**AI Response Excerpt**: "I'll create the Main driver class exactly as provided, which demonstrates base-class polymorphism, interface polymorphism, exception handling for invalid battery values, and heartbeat timestamp functionality."

**Prompt**: "Can you generate a transcript file for this package similar to the others in this repo?"

## Key Design Decisions Made

1. **Abstract Base Class**: Device provides common functionality (id, location, heartbeat, connection state) with abstract getStatus() method
2. **Interface Segregation**: Networked and BatteryPowered interfaces provide specific behaviors that can be mixed and matched
3. **Inheritance Hierarchy**: All concrete devices extend Device and implement relevant interfaces
4. **Polymorphism**: Both base-class polymorphism (Device references) and interface polymorphism (Networked, BatteryPowered) are demonstrated
5. **Input Validation**: Battery percentage validation throws IllegalArgumentException for values outside 0-100 range
6. **Protected Access**: Device's setConnected() method allows subclasses to manage connection state

## AI Assistance Summary

The AI assistant helped with:
- Overall system architecture design with inheritance and interfaces
- Abstract base class implementation with proper encapsulation
- Interface design following single responsibility principle
- Concrete class implementation with exact method signatures
- Driver class creation for comprehensive testing
- Compilation and testing to verify correct behavior
- Polymorphism demonstration through base-class and interface references

The final implementation successfully demonstrates object-oriented design principles including inheritance, interface implementation, polymorphism, and proper encapsulation while maintaining the exact specifications provided.
