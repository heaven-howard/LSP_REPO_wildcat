# AI Prompts and Responses for Midterm Question 2

This document contains the key prompts and AI responses used during the implementation of the AreaCalculator method overloading assignment. This file was generated by the AI assistant based on our conversation during the Midterm Question 2 implementation process.

## Prompt 1
**Prompt**: "Write a class AreaCalculator in the package org.howard.edu.lsp.midterm.question2 with the following overloaded methods: Circle area, Rectangle area, Triangle area, and Square area. Each method should compute and return the correct area and throw IllegalArgumentException if any dimension is ≤ 0."

**AI Response Excerpt**: "I'll help you create the AreaCalculator class with overloaded methods. Let me start by creating the necessary directory structure and implementing the classes with proper method signatures, calculations, and exception handling."

## Prompt 2: Method Implementation Details
**Prompt**: "Requirements: Circle area: π (use class Math.PI) × r², Rectangle area: width × height, Triangle area: ½ × base × height, Square area: side². For all methods: throw an IllegalArgumentException if any dimension is ≤ 0."

**AI Response Excerpt**: "I'll implement each method with the correct mathematical formulas:
- Circle: Math.PI * radius * radius
- Rectangle: width * height  
- Triangle: 0.5 * base * height
- Square: side * side

Each method will validate inputs and throw IllegalArgumentException for invalid dimensions."

## Prompt 3: Main Class Requirements
**Prompt**: "Create a class named Main that invokes each overloaded method statically to produce exactly the following output: Circle radius 3.0 → area = 28.274333882308138, Rectangle 5.0 x 2.0 → area = 10.0, Triangle base 10, height 6 → area = 30.0, Square side 4 → area = 16.0. Finally, invoke at least one of the area methods with a value that causes an IllegalArgumentException to be thrown."

**AI Response Excerpt**: "I'll create the Main class that demonstrates all overloaded methods and includes exception handling with try/catch blocks to show the IllegalArgumentException being thrown for invalid inputs."

## Prompt 4: Conceptual Understanding
**Prompt**: "Briefly (2–3 sentences as a comment in class Main) explain if overloading or simply use methods with different names, i.e., rectangleArea, circleArea, etc."

**AI Response Excerpt**: "I'll add a comment explaining why method overloading is the better design choice - it provides a clean, intuitive API where users can call the same method name for different shapes without having to remember different method names."

## Prompt 5: Code Refinement
**Prompt**: "can you do this Citations and References: You must cite all references for any material obtained from the internet. Any AI-generated content (e.g., ChatGPT conversations) must be included in full."
