# AI Prompts and Responses for Assignment 3

This document contains the key prompts and AI responses used during the object-oriented redesign of the ETL pipeline. This file was generated by the AI assistant based on our conversation during the Assignment 3 implementation process.

## Prompt 1
**Prompt**: "I need to redesign my Assignment 2 ETL pipeline to be more object-oriented. The current solution is a single class with static methods that reads CSV, transforms product data (uppercase name, electronics discount, recategorization, price range), and writes output. How should I break this into multiple classes with clear responsibilities?"

**AI Response Excerpt**: "I recommend breaking this into several focused classes:
1. **Product** - Represents a single product with validation
2. **ProductTransformer** - Handles all transformation logic
3. **CSVReader** - Manages CSV file reading
4. **CSVWriter** - Manages CSV file writing
5. **ETLResult** - Encapsulates pipeline results
6. **ETLPipeline** - Orchestrates the process

This follows the Single Responsibility Principle and makes each component testable independently."

## Prompt 2: Class Design Details
**Prompt**: "For the Product class, what fields and methods should I include? The CSV has ProductID, Name, Price, Category columns, and I need to add PriceRange after transformation."

**AI Response Excerpt**: "The Product class should include:
- Private fields for all attributes (productId, name, price, category, priceRange)
- Constructor that takes the basic fields
- Getter and setter methods for all fields
- An isValid() method for data validation
- A toString() method for CSV output formatting

This encapsulates the product data and provides a clean interface for manipulation."

## Prompt 3: Transformation Logic
**Prompt**: "How should I structure the ProductTransformer class to handle the business rules: uppercase name, 10% electronics discount, recategorization for high-priced electronics, and price range calculation?"

**AI Response Excerpt**: "Structure the ProductTransformer with:
- A main transform() method that orchestrates all transformations
- Private helper methods for each transformation step
- Constants for business rule values (discount rate, thresholds)
- Clear separation of concerns with each transformation in its own method

This makes the transformation logic modular and easy to test or modify individual rules."

## Prompt 4: Error Handling
**Prompt**: "How should I handle malformed data and validation errors in the object-oriented design?"

**AI Response Excerpt**: "Implement validation at multiple levels:
- Product.isValid() for basic data validation
- CSVReader should return null for malformed rows
- ProductTransformer should return null for invalid products
- ETLPipeline should count and report skipped rows

This provides graceful error handling while maintaining the same behavior as Assignment 2."

## Prompt 5: Testing Strategy
**Prompt**: "How can I verify that my object-oriented redesign produces the same output as the original implementation?"

**AI Response Excerpt**: "Test both implementations with identical scenarios:
1. Normal operation with valid data
2. Missing input file
3. Empty input file
4. Malformed data rows

Compare the output files byte-for-byte and verify error messages are identical. This ensures functional equivalence while gaining the benefits of object-oriented design."

## Key Design Decisions Made

1. **Encapsulation**: Each class encapsulates its own data and behavior
2. **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one clear purpose
3. **Dependency Injection**: ETLPipeline accepts dependencies for testability
4. **Validation**: Centralized validation in Product class
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling with null returns for invalid data
6. **Constants**: Business rules defined as class constants for maintainability

## Prompt 6: Documentation Request
**Prompt**: "can you generate an ai prompt file based on our conversation with these guidelines"

**AI Response Excerpt**: "I'll create the AI prompts file according to the given guidelines."

## AI Assistance Summary

The AI assistant helped with:
- Overall architecture design and class responsibilities
- Specific class structure and method design
- Error handling strategies
- Testing approaches
- Code organization and best practices
- Documentation generation and file creation

The final implementation successfully transforms the procedural code into a well-structured object-oriented system while maintaining identical functionality.
